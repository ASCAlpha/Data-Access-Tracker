The keyboard_navigation.js file, as described in the Canvas document, is a JavaScript script designed to enhance keyboard accessibility for the Data Access Tracker's web pages.

It provides the following key features for keyboard navigation:

Sidebar Control:

You can toggle the sidebar open or closed using the keyboard shortcut Alt + S.

Once the sidebar is open, you can navigate between its links using the ArrowUp and ArrowDown keys.

Pressing the Escape key will close the sidebar.

User Dropdown Control:

The user dropdown menu can be toggled open or closed using Alt + U.

When the user avatar (which acts as the toggle) is focused, you can also open the dropdown by pressing Enter or Space.

Within the open dropdown, ArrowUp and ArrowDown keys allow you to navigate through the menu items.

The Escape key will close the user dropdown.

This script aims to improve the overall usability of the application for users who prefer or require keyboard navigation.
